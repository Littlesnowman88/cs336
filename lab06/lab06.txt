Exercise 6.1
A) The browser can use GET and POST (POST for http forms).
  The browser cannot use PUT or DELETE because the browser lacks permission
  to modify files on the server.
  Using curl inside the lab's directory, I successfully received responses from
  GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

B)HTTP response code 404 (NOT_FOUND) is the most appropriate http
  response code for pages not defined by an Express route.

Exercise 6.2
I worked with Catherine DeJager on trying to successfully post data to the
   forms section but couldn't get it to format correctly when using curl.
A) Since I couldn't get POST to properly work for my lab, I looked around online.
   It appears that HTTP forms support GET and POST--get retrieves existent data
   and post creates new data without overwriting old data.
   PUT and DELETE change existing data, but HTTP forms don't hold onto data
   like a database does, so PUT and DELETE make no sense for an http form.

B) With the way I think the lab is supposed to work, the data is supposed to be
   passed to the server in a JSON. The server can use npm body parser to retreive
   the JSON data--when the data is formatted correctly.
   The data becomes key-value pairs that the server can look up, since JSON
   stores data in key-value pairs. Other than that, though, I don't think
   the data is changed.
