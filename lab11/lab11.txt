Exercise 11.1
A) Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain
   how each is designed.
   Both deployments bundle everything into bundle.js and both deployements use postcss.
   The development deployment hosts a separate development server on 3001, using 3000
   as a proxy. The production environment will not be using localhost as a server
   environment, so it does not need to open up extra ports and proxies on the local machine.

B) List the optimizations you've configured for this production version and, if
   possible, find evidence of them in the deployed application files.
   We added two optimizations: OccurenceOrderPlugin and UglifyJsPlugin.
   I'm pretty sure UglifyJsPlugin will remove whitespace from javascript (possibly in
   bundle.js) and will compress what files it can as it serves up files.
   I had to look up OccurenceOrderPlugin. From
   https://github.com/styopdev/webpack-interview-questions/issues/2,
   this opitmization can reduce the size of bundle.js by sorting modules
   based on their occurrence (frequency of use??).

Exercise 11.2
A) What advantage is there in deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?

B) How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling
   it from the specified branch on GitHub)?
