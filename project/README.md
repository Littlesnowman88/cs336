# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
## Vision Statement
### author: Littlesnowman88
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe raises the strategy of normal tic-tac-toe to greater heights!
With a 3x3 board of tic-tac-toe games, two opponents face off to achieve three games won in a row.
Nevertheless, opponents do not play games in sequence. Rather, they play all of the games at once!
How is this possible?
When playerX marks a small tic-tac-toe board, playerO must switch to the corresponding small tic-tac-toe board and mark a circle there.
Then, when playerO has marked his or her small tic-tac-toe board, playerX must switch to the board that matches playerO's circle placement.
When a small tic-tac-toe board has been completed, neither player may mark that game. Instead, if a player encounters a completed small game, the player gets to play on any open game.
Jason Klaassen and I both would like to work on this two-player, single page web application.
